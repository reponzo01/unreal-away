- I started off by creating a Vehicle Template project, then adding in the VR Template as a "feature".

- Probably best to create a new player controller and move all vehicle controller to it.
- or use the vechicle controller in the vr game mode.
- also, in the sports car pawn, the back camera has auto activate ticked.

- will need to move all car pawn mechanics in event graph to vr pawn.
